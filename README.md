City Search app
USERS put in a City name and the application will display all of the associated zip codes to the user.

To get started run the following commands

create-react-app city-search
cd city-search
npm start


Implement a City Search field that takes city names
it should allow city names to be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case letters
Display all zip codes received from the API
Stretch Features (Optional, but highly recommended)
Display all states where the city was found in the API
Group received zip codes by state
Display city details for each Zip code
Note: these will require additional fetch call to the API. Feel free to use your own CSS styles and to add any additional features you want.
